# S9 Input Method for Android#
S9 is an Android input method that utilizes swipe motions to distinguish different characters on a single key.

## State of Project ##
I (Gilbert) have decided to stop working on this for a variety of reasons. I thought someone would be interested in picking it up or forking it, so I put it on GitHub.

## Demo ##
Watch [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d1Frz6l4OU "Demo")

## Installation ##
If you want to play around with it (it's still WIP), download S9.apk from repo and do the following:

1. Install ASTRO file manager from market
2. Goto settings -> applications -> check "unknown sources"
3. Transfer attached .apk to SD card.
4. Open ASTRO manager, find S9.apk, open it with app manager, install
5. Settings -> Language & Keyboard -> make sure S9 is checked
6. Find some input field, long press -> input method -> choose S9

The [Sample Soft Keyboard](http://developer.android.com/resources/samples/SoftKeyboard/index.html "Sample Soft Keyboard"), [android-greek-ime](http://code.google.com/p/android-greek-ime/ "android-greek-ime"), and the [LatinIME source code](http://android.git.kernel.org/?p=platform/packages/inputmethods/LatinIME.git;a=tree "LatinIME Source Code") are great places to figure out how to do things.
